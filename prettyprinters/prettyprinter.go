//Package prettyprinters provides a general interface and concrete
//implementations for implementing prettyprinters.  This package was originally
//created to facilitate the development of graphviz visualizations for resource
//graphs, however it is intended to be useful for creating arbitrary output
//generators so that resource graph data can be used in other applications.
