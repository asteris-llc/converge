## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/asteris-llc/converge
```

or download a release for your platform from the
[releases page on Github](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/releases).

## Usage

Converge uses [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) as a base for
configuration, on top of which it add it's own semantics.

The basic unit of composition in converge is the module. Modules have parameters
and can call tasks and render templates, among other things. Your usage is
likely to look this this:

```hcl
# install traefik
param "version" {}

module "yum" "traefik" {}

module "systemd-unit-enabled" "traefik" {
  requires = ["yum.traefik"]
}

module "systemd-unit-running" "traefik" {
  requires = ["yum.traefik"]
}
```

Invoke this with `converge apply traefik.hcl` to install Traefik from yum on
your system. You can also `converge plan traefik.hcl` to see what changes will
be made before you apply them.

### Writing Modules

The content of a simple module is below:

```hcl
# start a systemd unit
param "name" {}

task "start-unit" {
  check = "systemctl status {{param `name`}} | tee /dev/stderr | grep -q running"
  apply = "systemctl start {{param `name`}}"
}
```

Within a module, you can have tasks. Shown here is a task with two stanzas:

- `check` returns the actual state, and an error code indicating if it needs to
  be changed
- `apply` is run to create the resource controlled by this task. You can omit
  this stanza if you want the command to be purely informational.

If the exit code of `check` is non-zero, `apply` will be called, after which
time `check` will be called again to get the new state and success.

A module can have multiple tasks. It can also have templates, which render data
to the filesystem from the module's parameters:

```hcl
# create systemd unit file
param "name" {}

param "execStart" {}

param "user" {
  default = "root"
}

param "group" {
  default = "root"
}

param "description" {
  default = "{{param `name`}}"
}

file.content "unit" {
  destination = "/etc/systemd/system/{{param `name`}}.service"

  content = <<EOF
[Unit]
Description={{param `description`}}
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
User={{param `user`}}
Group={{param `group`}}
ExecStart={{param `execStart`}}

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
}

task "reload-daemon" {
  check    = "systemd-delta --type=overridden {{param `name`}}"
  apply    = "systemctl daemon-reload"
  requires = ["file.content.unit"]
}
```

This module creates a systemd unit file and registers it with the system. Note
that both resource blocks have a name, and that "daemon-reload" depends on
"unit". Converge uses these dependencies to determine execution order.

The arguments for the `file.content` resource:

- `destination`: where to render the template. If you don't want to render to
  disk, omit this stanza. In that case, you can access the rendered template
  with the `template` template function.
- `content`: this can be a string, a multi-line string (as in the example above)
  or any template function that returns a string. Converge intelligently renders
  the template until there are no more blocks, so sourcing a template from a
  template is fine.

### Built-in Modules

Converge ships with a number of built-in modules. These can be used for common
tasks without having to write your own `task` declarations.

#### Systemd Modules

##### Start (systemd.start)

systemd.start starts a unit

| parameter | required | default | choices | comments |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | :-----: | -------- |
| unit      | yes      |         |         | It takes a unit file to disable (either just the file name or full absolute path if the unit file is residing outside the usual unit search paths) |
| Mode      | no       | replace | * replace * fail * isolate * ignore-dependencies * ignore-requirements | The mode needs to be one of replace, fail, isolate, ignore-dependencies, ignore-requirements. If "replace" the call will start the unit and its dependencies, possibly replacing already queued jobs that conflict with this. If "fail" the call will start the unit and its dependencies, but will fail if this would change an already queued job. If "isolate" the call will start the unit in question and terminate all units that aren't dependencies of it. If "ignore-dependencies" it will start a unit but ignore all its dependencies. If "ignore-requirements" it will start a unit but only ignore the requirement dependencies. It is not recommended to make use of the latter two options. Returns the newly created job object.|
| timeout   | no       | 5 s     |         | Time to wait for unit to finish reloading, activating, or stopping before checking |

##### Stop (systemd.stop)

systemd.stop stops a unit

| parameter | required | default | choices | comments |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | :-----: | -------- |
| unit      | yes      |         |         | It takes a unit file to disable (either just the file name or full absolute path if the unit file is residing outside the usual unit search paths) |
| Mode      | no       | replace | * replace * fail * isolate * ignore-dependencies * ignore-requirements | The mode needs to be one of replace, fail, isolate, ignore-dependencies, ignore-requirements. If "replace" the call will start the unit and its dependencies, possibly replacing already queued jobs that conflict with this. If "fail" the call will start the unit and its dependencies, but will fail if this would change an already queued job. If "isolate" the call will start the unit in question and terminate all units that aren't dependencies of it. If "ignore-dependencies" it will start a unit but ignore all its dependencies. If "ignore-requirements" it will start a unit but only ignore the requirement dependencies. It is not recommended to make use of the latter two options. Returns the newly created job object.|
| timeout   | no       | 5 s     |         | Time to wait for unit to finish reloading, activating, or stopping before checking |

##### Enable (systemd.enable)

systemd.enable enables a unit

| parameter | required | default | choices | comments |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | :-----: | -------- |
| unit      | yes      |         |         | It takes a unit file to disable (either just the file name or full absolute path if the unit file is residing outside the usual unit search paths) |
| runtime   | no       | false   | * true * false | whether the unit shall be enabled for runtime only (true, /run), or persistently (false, /etc)|
| force     | no       | false   | * true * false | whether symlinks pointing to other units shall be replaced if necessary.|
| timeout   | no       | 5 s     |         | Time to wait for unit to finish reloading, activating, or stopping before checking |

##### Disable (systemd.disable)

systemd.disable disables a unit

| parameter | required | default | choices | comments |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | :-----: | -------- |
| unit      | yes      |         |         | It takes a unit file to disable (either just the file name or full absolute path if the unit file is residing outside the usual unit search paths) |
| runtime   | no       | false   | * true * false | whether the unit shall be enabled for runtime only (true, /run), or persistently (false, /etc)|
| timeout   | no       | 5 s     |         | Time to wait for unit to finish reloading, activating, or stopping before checking |


#### File Modules

##### Mode (file.mode)

The `file.mode` module takes two required parameters: 

- `destination`: the file whose permissions should be checked
- `mode`: the octal mode of the file

Sample:

```hcl
file.mode "test" {
  destination = "test.txt"
  mode        = "0644"
}
```

### Server

Converge can run a server to serve modules for bootstrapping. It can also host
itself for downloading onto new systems. Use `converge server` to start it. See
the `--help` for how to enable HTTPS.

#### Module Hosting

Modules are hosted at `/modules/`, which is a simple directory listing (control
with `--root`, set to the current working directory by default), and will be
made available publically. Use these modules by running `converge plan
http://your.host:8080/modules/yourModule.hcl` or similar.

#### Binary Hosting

Converge can also host its own binary. This is turned off by default, and is
enabled with the `--self-serve` flag to `converge server`. You can use this to
bootstrap a new system without downloading the relevant version of converge over
an external connection. It will be available at
`http://your.host:8080/bootstrap/binary`.
