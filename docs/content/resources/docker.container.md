Container is responsible for creating docker containers. It assumes that
there is already a Docker daemon running on the system.
*Note: docker resources are not currently supported on Solaris.*


## Example

```hcl
/* docker resources are currently not supported on solaris */
docker.container "nginx" {
  name  = "nginx"
  image = "nginx:1.10-alpine"
  force = "true"

  ports = [
    "80",
  ]

  env {
    "FOO" = "BAR"
  }
}

```

- `ports` (list of strings)
