represents the elapsed time between two instants as an int64 nanosecond count.
The representation limits the largest representable duration to approximately
290 years. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers,
each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or
"2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
