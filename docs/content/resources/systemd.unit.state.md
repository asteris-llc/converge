## Parameters

Here are the HCL fields that you can specify, along with their expected types
and restrictions:



## Exported Fields

Here are the fields that are exported for use with 'lookup'.  Re-exported fields
will have their own fields exported under the re-exported namespace.


- `unit` (string)

  The name of the unit, including the unit type.
 
- `state` (string)

  The desired state of the unit as configured by the user. It will be one of
`running`, `stopped`, or `restarted` if it was configured by the user, and
an empty string otherwise.
 
- `reload` (bool)

  This field is set to true if the reload flag was configured by the user.
 
- `signal_name` (string)

  The human-readable name of a unix signal that will be sent to the process.
If this is set the name will match the field set in SignalNumber.  See the
man pages for `signal(3)` on BSD/Darwin or `signal(7)` on GNU Linux for a
full explanation of these signals.
 
- `signal_number` (uint)

  The numeric identifier of a unix signal that will be sent to the process.
If this is set it will match the field set in SignalName.  See the man
pages for `signal(3)` on BSD/Darwin or `signal(7)` on GNU Linux for a full
explanation of these signals.
 
- `path` (string)

  The full path to the unit file on disk. This field will be empty if the
unit was not started from a systemd unit file on disk.
 
- `description` (string)

  Description of the services. This field will be empty unless a description
has been provided in the systemd unit file.
 
- `activestate` (string)

  The active state of the unit. It will always be one of: `active`,
`reloading`, `inactive`, `failed`, `activating`, `deactivating`.
 
- `loadstate` (string)

  The load state of the unit.
 
- `type` (UnitType)

  The type of the unit as an enumerated value.  See TypeStr for a human
readable type.
 
- `typestr` (string)

  The type of the unit as a human readable string.  See the man page for
`systemd(1)` for a full description of the types and their meaning.
 
- `status` (string)

  The status represents the current status of the process.  It will be
initialized during planning and updated after apply to reflect any changes.
 
- `global_properties` re-exports fields from Properties

  Properties are the global systemd unit properties and will be set for all
unit types.  See
