Owner sets the file and group ownership of a file or directory.  If
`recursive` is set to true and `destination` is a directory, then it will
also recursively change ownership of all files and subdirectories.  Symlinks
are ignored.


## Example

```hcl
/* This file demonstrates proper usage of the file.owner module by creating a
 new file, then changing the ownership of that file to a different group. */

file.content "to-change" {
  destination = "to-change"
}

task.query "existing-group" {
  interpreter = "/bin/bash"
  query       = "echo -n $(ls -la {{lookup `file.content.to-change.destination`}} | awk '{print $4}')"
}

task.query "new-group" {
  interpreter = "/bin/bash"
  query       = "echo -n $(groups | xargs -n 1 echo | grep -v $(whoami) | grep -v {{lookup `task.query.existing-group.status.stdout`}} | head -n1)"
}

file.owner "owner-test" {
  destination = "{{lookup `file.content.to-change.destination`}}"
  group       = "{{lookup `task.query.new-group.status.stdout`}}"
}

```


## Parameters

Here are the HCL fields that you can specify, along with their expected types
and restrictions:


- `destination` (required string)

  Destination is the location on disk where the content will be rendered.

- `recursive` (bool)

  Recursive indicates whether ownership changes should be applied
recursively.  Symlinks are not followed.

- `user` (string)

  Username specifies user-owernship by user name

- `uid` (optional int)


	Only one of `user` may be set.

  UID specifies user-ownership by UID

- `group` (string)


	Only one of `gid` may be set.

  Groupname specifies group-ownership by groupname

- `gid` (optional int)


	Only one of `group` may be set.

  GID specifies group ownership by gid

- osProxy (OSProxy)



## Exported Fields

Here are the fields that are exported for use with 'lookup'.  Re-exported fields
will have their own fields exported under the re-exported namespace.


- `destination` (string)
  the path to the file that should change; or if `recursive` is set, the path
to the root of the filesystem to recursively change.
 
- `username` (string)
  the username of the user that should be given ownership of the file
 
- `uid` (string)
  the uid of the user that should be given ownership of the file
 
- `group` (string)
  the group name of the group that should be given ownership of the file
 
- `gid` (string)
  the gid of the group that should be given ownership of the file
 
- `recursive` (bool)
  if true, and `destination` is a directory, apply changes recursively
