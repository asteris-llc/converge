## Release Date

Unreleased.

## Features

This release includes a number of significant improvements to the core engine including conditionals,
wait queries, named locks, and the ability to use lists and maps in parameters. The internal API has
also been simplified to make it easier for programmers to create new modules.

### Module Improvements

#### RPM Resource

RPM package install/uninstall support has been added via [#373](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/373).

```hcl
rpm.package "mc" {
    name  = "mc"
    state = "present"
}
```

#### User and group

Linux user groups can now be modified via [#279](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/279)

#### wait.query and wait.port

Support for waiting for a task or port was [#334](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/334). A user
can now structure workflows where tasks can wait for a port to be open or a condition to be met.

Below is an example of waiting for a port to be open using the `wait.port` resource:

```hcl
wait.port "8080" {
  host         = "localhost"
  port         = 8080
  interval     = "1s"
  max_retry    = 10
  grace_period = "2s"
}
```

The following shows using `wait.query` to wait using a task:

```hcl
wait.query "service-health" {
  check        = "nc -z localhost 8080"
  interval     = "1s"
  max_retry    = 10
  grace_period = "1s"
}
```

Wait is documented at: [wait.port]({{< relref "resources/wait.port.md" >}}) and [wait.query]({{< relref "resources/wait.query.md" >}}).


### Engine Improvements

#### Conditional Support

Support for conditionals via [#362](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/362).

In the following example, the contents of file `greetings.txt` depend on the value of
the `lang` parameter:

```hcl
param "lang" {
  default = ""
}

switch "test-switch" {
  case "eq `spanish` `{{param `lang`}}`" "spanish" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "hola\n"
    }
  }

  case "eq `french` `{{param `lang`}}`" "french" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "salut\n"
    }
  }

```

#### Named Locks

Basic locks have been added to the engine. This allows workflows where multiple tasks run
one at a time instead of in parallel. Locks are added as a node in the graph and released
after all tasks sharing the lock are complete.

For example, `apt` package installs cannot run in parallel. In the following example
each task with the `apt` lock is run sequentially.

```hcl
task "install-jq" {
  check = "dpkg -s jq >/dev/null 2>&1"
  apply = "apt-get update 2>&1 > /dev/null && apt-get -y install jq"
  lock  = "apt"
}

task "install-build-essential" {
  check = "dpkg -s build-essential >/dev/null 2>&1"
  apply = "apt-get update 2>&1 > /dev/null && apt-get -y install build-essential"
  lock  = "apt"
}
```

#### Enhanced Parameter Values

`bool`, `list`, and `map` types have been added to parameters via [#340](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/340).

See [values]({{< ref "params-and-templates.md#Values" >}})

#### Output Improvements

Text output for changes is now aligned via [#317](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/317).

## Bug Fixes

- docker.container regression [#343](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/343)
- handle parameters with valid zero value [#338](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/338)
- shell module should not set StatusLevel based on process exit code [#323](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/323)
- param dependency fails in `samples/shellContext.hcl` [#313](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/313)
- Execution Engine Ignoring Warning Levels [#243](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/243)
- Make pipeline functions use mult-return instead of Either [#225](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues/225)
- cmd/server.go: use errgroup instead of waitgroup [#363](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/363)

## Examples/Documentation

A Docker image was created in [#372](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/372) to speed up Wercker builds and automated tests.

Documentation was updated in [#371](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/371) so that links like
[converge.aster.is/0.2.0](https://converge.aster.is/0.2.0) will resolve documentation for that version.

## Support

We provide support via [the Converge Slack team](http://converge-slack.aster.is/) and through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues)
