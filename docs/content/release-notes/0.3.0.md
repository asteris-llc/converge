## Release Date

Unreleased, scheduled for the week of 10/17/2016.

## Features

RPM package install/uninstall support was added in [\#373](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/373).

Support for conditionals in [\#362](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/362). This means you can now
define workflows like the following:

```hcl
param "lang" {
  default = ""
}

switch "test-switch" {
  case "eq `spanish` `{{param `lang`}}`" "spanish" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "hola\n"
    }
  }

  case "eq `french` `{{param `lang`}}`" "french" {
    file.content "foo-file" {
      destination = "greeting.txt"
      content     = "salut\n"
    }
  }

```

Documentation was updated in [\#371](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/371) so that links like
[converge.aster.is/0.2.0](https://converge.aster.is/0.2.0) will resolve documentation for that version.

## Bug Fixes

This releases fixes several race condition (#266) and ordering (#254) bugs that would cause Converge to error out of otherwise valid executions.

## Examples

A Docker image was created in [\#372](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/pull/372) to speed up Wercker builds and automated tests.

## Support

We provide support via [the Converge Slack team](http://converge-slack.aster.is/) and through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/asteris-llc/converge/issues)
